# PyFCM
This is a set of Python scripts written by Payam Aminpour for Researchers who want to run more robust analysis with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. In this package we offer FCM aggregation techniques, FCM Clustering, FCM Scenario Analysis, FCM Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis, Credibility test, and data visualization.  

This is a refactoring and expansion of the original PyFCM [https://github.com/payamaminpour/PyFCM/](https://github.com/payamaminpour/PyFCM)
